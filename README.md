Studied the Game Theory, and specifically the function of Minimax to further implement it in the game.
- Minimax: The name "minimax" comes from minimizing the loss involved when the opponent selects the strategy that gives maximum loss, and is useful in analyzing the first    player's decisions both when the players move sequentially and when the players move simultaneously.
  
  - The simplest example is assigning a "1" to a winning position and "-1" to a losing one.
